This study used machine learning models to estimate stellar rotation periods from corrected light curves of NASA Kepler missions. Traditional methods often struggle with noise and variability in light curve data, leading to inaccurate estimates. The workflow involved initial estimates from LS-Periodogram and Transit Least Squares, followed by splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Machine learning algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting were employed, and a Voting Ensemble (Multi-Model) approach was used to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. The analysis included multiple Kepler IDs, providing detailed metrics on orbital periods and planet radii. Performance metrics showed the Voting Ensemble model yielded the most accurate results, with an RMSE of 0.558 for KIC 9818381. Comparisons of predicted versus photometric reference rotation periods showed close alignment, indicating high prediction accuracy. The findings suggest machine learning models, particularly ensemble methods, can effectively solve the problem of accurately predicting stellar rotation periods, with significant potential for advancing the study of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics.
